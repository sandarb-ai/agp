# AIGP Trademark Policy

**Effective Date:** February 2025
**Owner:** Sandarb AI ([sandarb.ai](https://sandarb.ai))

---

## Purpose

The names **"AI Governance Proof"** and **"AIGP"** (collectively, the "AIGP Marks") identify an open specification for structured, cryptographic governance events. This trademark policy exists to protect the meaning of those names so that when someone sees "AIGP," they can trust it refers to a single, interoperable standard — not a fragmented set of incompatible forks.

The AIGP specification is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](./LICENSE), which explicitly reserves trademark rights (Section 6). This policy explains what that reservation means in practice.

**Our goal is simple:** protect the integrity of the standard while making it as easy as possible for the community to use, implement, and talk about AIGP.

## The Marks

The following are trademarks of Sandarb AI:

| Mark | Type |
|------|------|
| **AI Governance Proof** | Word mark |
| **AIGP** | Word mark (abbreviation) |
| **AIGP** logo / icon | Design mark |
| **AIGP Certified** | Certification mark (reserved) |
| **AIGP Compliant** | Certification mark (reserved) |

## What You Can Do (No Permission Needed)

The following uses are **automatically permitted** and do not require written approval:

### 1. Talk About AIGP

You may use the AIGP name in text, documentation, blog posts, talks, academic papers, and social media to refer to the AIGP specification. Examples:

- "Our platform produces AIGP events."
- "This library validates AIGP event schemas."
- "AIGP: An Open Standard for AI Governance Auditing" (article title)
- "Introduction to AIGP" (conference talk)

### 2. Describe Compatibility

You may state that your product or implementation is compatible with the AIGP specification, provided the statement is truthful and your implementation actually conforms to the published schema.

**Approved patterns:**

- "Compatible with AIGP"
- "Supports AIGP event format"
- "AIGP-compatible events"
- "[Your Product] for AIGP"
- "Built on the AIGP specification"

### 3. Community and Education

You may use the AIGP name for:

- Non-commercial community meetups, study groups, and workshops
- Open-source tooling that operates on AIGP events (parsers, validators, converters)
- Educational content (courses, tutorials, guides)
- Academic research and publications

### 4. Refer to the Specification

You may link to, quote from, and reference the AIGP specification in your own documentation. The specification itself is Apache 2.0 licensed.

### 5. Fork and Modify the Code

You may fork the AIGP repository, modify the schema, and use the code under the Apache 2.0 license — as long as your fork is not named "AIGP" (see Restricted Uses below).

---

## What Requires Permission

The following uses **require explicit written approval** from Sandarb AI (trademark@sandarb.ai):

### 1. Product or Service Names

Using "AIGP" as part of a product name, service name, or company name:

- "AIGP Cloud"
- "AIGP Analytics"
- "OpenAIGP"

### 2. Domain Names

Registering domain names that include "AIGP" in a way that could imply official status:

- `aigp-spec.com`
- `aigp-tools.io`
- `getaigp.dev`

### 3. Commercial Conferences and Events

Using "AIGP" in the name of a commercial conference, paid workshop, or for-profit event:

- "AIGP Summit 2026"
- "AIGP Conference"

### 4. Merchandise

Producing merchandise (t-shirts, stickers, etc.) bearing the AIGP name or logo for commercial sale.

---

## What Is Not Permitted

The following uses are **never permitted**, regardless of context:

### 1. Naming Forks or Derivative Specifications

If you fork the AIGP specification and modify it in ways that create incompatibilities with the official spec, you **must not** call your fork "AIGP," "AIGP 2.0," "AIGP Extended," or any confusingly similar name.

**Why:** If two incompatible specs both call themselves "AIGP," the name becomes meaningless. The whole point of a standard is that it means the same thing everywhere.

**What to do instead:** Give your fork a distinct name. You may say: "Based on the AIGP specification" or "Derived from AIGP v0.2."

### 2. Implying Official Endorsement

You may not use the AIGP Marks in a way that suggests your product, service, or organization is officially endorsed by, affiliated with, or sponsored by the AIGP project or Sandarb AI — unless that is actually the case.

### 3. Using Reserved Certification Terms

The following terms are **reserved** for implementations that have passed official conformance testing administered by the Compliance Working Group (see [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md)):

- **"AIGP Certified"**
- **"AIGP Compliant"**
- **"AIGP Conformant"**
- **"Certified AIGP"**

You may not use these terms to describe your implementation unless it has passed the official conformance test suite and received written certification.

> **Note:** The conformance testing program is under development. Until it launches, no implementation — including Sandarb's own — may claim "AIGP Certified" status. The honest term today is "AIGP-compatible."

### 4. Altering the Marks

You may not modify, abbreviate, or combine the AIGP Marks with other marks in a way that creates a new composite mark (e.g., "AIGP+" or "SuperAIGP").

The AIGP logo and icon may be used in the following contexts without permission:

- Including in presentations or articles about the specification

The logo may **not** be:

- Modified, recolored, or distorted
- Used as your own product or company logo
